                <p>My passion for coding started early and I've been surrounded by computers my whole life. In high school I was the captain of my robotics team for three years and ran track and cross country for all four. After High School I studied Biology at Xavier University in Cincinnati. I recently moved to Cary, North Carolina. I am looking to transition into a career that more closely aligns with my passions. Currently I am a student in UNC's web development bootcamp to become a Full-Stack developer beginning my journey towards doing just that.</p>
